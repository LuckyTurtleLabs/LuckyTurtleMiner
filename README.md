# 🐢 LuckyTurtleMiner

**Open, self-hosted embedded mining software**  
Built for ownership, transparency, and low-overhead hardware.

---

## 🚧 Project Status

**Early development — not production ready**

LuckyTurtleMiner is under active development.  
APIs, configuration methods, supported hardware, and features may change.

This project is shared publicly for learning, experimentation, and collaboration — not as a finished or commercial product.

---

## What Is LuckyTurtleMiner?

LuckyTurtleMiner is an embedded mining project designed for **small, low-power hardware** (such as ESP32-class devices), with a focus on:

- Local ownership and control  
- Minimal overhead and dependencies  
- Transparent, understandable behavior  
- Self-hosted infrastructure

The goal is to make mining software that is **inspectable, approachable, and controlled by the operator**, rather than hidden behind cloud services or abstraction layers.

---

## What This Project Is *Not*

To avoid confusion, LuckyTurtleMiner is **not**:

- ❌ A hosted or cloud mining service  
- ❌ A profitability or earnings product  
- ❌ Financial advice  
- ❌ Designed for industrial-scale mining  

LuckyTurtleMiner exists to support **learning, experimentation, and infrastructure ownership**, not hype or guarantees.

---

## Design Principles

LuckyTurtleMiner follows a few core principles:

- **Ownership over convenience**  
  Your hardware, your node, your configuration.

- **Transparency over abstraction**  
  No hidden behavior. Clear operation is preferred over magic.

- **Simplicity over bloat**  
  Small devices deserve small, focused software.

- **Local-first configuration**  
  Setup and operation happen on the device whenever possible.

---

## Intended Capabilities (Roadmap)

Planned and in-progress goals include:

- Embedded mining support for low-power hardware
- Simple local web interface for configuration
- Clear on-device status and metrics
- Compatibility with self-hosted nodes and pools
- Documentation that explains *how it works*, not just *how to run it*

This roadmap will evolve as development progresses.

---

## Hardware Focus

LuckyTurtleMiner is being developed with **embedded platforms** in mind, including:

- ESP32-class microcontrollers  
- Small TFT or OLED displays  
- Low-power, always-on operation  

Specific supported hardware and configurations will be documented as the project matures.

### Closing Note

LuckyTurtleMiner is intentionally **incremental, transparent, and honest**.

If you’re interested in understanding mining infrastructure at a practical level — and building it yourself — you’re in the right place.
