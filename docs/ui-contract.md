# UI Contract (Locked)

The UI data contract is now locked for v0.1 of LuckyTurtleMiner.

All device UI screens and web UI pages must be driven by the fields defined in:
- docs/ui-data.md

This contract ensures:
- Firmware and UI remain decoupled
- Device screen and web UI stay consistent
- Future UI changes do not break firmware

Any changes to UI fields must be versioned and discussed before implementation.
