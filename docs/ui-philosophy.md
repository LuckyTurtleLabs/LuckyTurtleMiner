# LuckyTurtleMiner UI Philosophy (v0.1)

Goal: Friendly “turtle club” feel — calm, clean, easy to read.

## Style
- Dark background
- Turtle green accent (#36d27a)
- Rounded cards and soft spacing
- Clear, simple wording (no panic messages)

## Rules
- Status first (connected, hashing, shares, uptime)
- Green = good, yellow = connecting, red = needs attention
- No flashing or noisy animations
- Same truth on device screen and web UI

## Screens (planned)
On-device:
1) Home / Status
2) Connecting
3) Needs Attention
4) Info

Web:
1) Status
2) Setup
3) Logs
4) About
